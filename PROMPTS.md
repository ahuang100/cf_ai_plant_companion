This document contains prompts I passed to claude code used during the development of the cf_ai_plant_companion project.

**Prompt:**
> I want to build an assistant that helps you care for your houseplants with personalized reminders. I'll build on top of the current template project initialized via Cloudflare's Agent SDK. I will be using an LLM (recommend using Llama 3.3 on Workers AI), Workflow/coordination, User input via chat, and Memory or state that tracks each plant's watering history, health issues, and care preferences. Remember this in the development of this project. 

**Prompt:**
> How do I configure the Durable Object bindings in wrangler.jsonc for the plant care system?

**Response Summary:** Updated wrangler.jsonc to use PlantCare instead of Chat, configured SQLite bindings and migrations.

**Prompt:**
> What's the proper way to initialize SQLite tables in a Durable Object constructor? How would you structure the database based on the project outline?

**Response Summary:** Create an initializeDatabase() method with CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS statements for plants, watering_history, and health_issues tables.

**Prompt:**
> The model is responding with "Your input is lacking necessary details" to simple questions like "How often should I water my Pothos?" How do I fix this?

**Response Summary:** Updated system prompt to explicitly allow the AI to answer general plant care questions directly without requiring tool calls.

**Prompt:** I want to make tool calls the agent can use for certain functionalities, like interacting with my database. Can you show where I can start implementing this and create the following tools as well? (adding plants, recording watering events, and checking which plants need watering)
**Response Summary:** Implemented addPlant, waterPlant, and checkWateringNeeds tools with Zod schemas. 

**Prompt:**
> The addPlant tool is failing with a validation error: "Expected number, received string" for waterFrequencyDays. How do I fix this?

**Response Summary:** Changed z.number() to z.coerce.number() to automatically convert string inputs to numbers.

**Prompt:**
> If I set a plant's watering schedule to 7 days, what reminder is sent once it reaches 7 days? I'll grant you permissions to test some scheduling requests to verify behavior. 

**Response Summary:** Explained that reminders add messages to chat history when triggered, but don't show browser notifications. Created and ran test instructions for 30-second reminder.

**Prompt:**
> Can you create a UI interface that lets me access debug messages to show the JSON structure of messages including tool invocations/results. A simple bug icon to toggle the additional information should suffice. 

**Prompt:**
> Analyze my codebase now. Edit the README file to list all available features and make sure the proper instruction for starting the application is included. Give some instructions for potential deployment and also an overview of the tech stack.
